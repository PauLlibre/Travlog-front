# Traveling Web App

Welcome to the Traveling Web App! This app allows users to browse routes that other users have created, as well as create their own routes. Routes are made by choosing the city you want to make the route in, adding a title and a description to it, and using the Google Maps API to create complex routes that pass through specific tourist places. This way, users can decide which route to pick when they visit a country, and the route will provide them with information about the places they are going to visit.

## Early Stages

It is important to note that the application is still in really early stages of development. The app is currently deployed in AWS S3, Mongo Atlas and Railway for the API, and there are a lot of bugs that need to be fixed. However, we are actively working on improving the app and fixing any issues that arise.

## Features

- Browse routes created by other users
- Create your own routes by choosing a city and adding a title and description
- Use the Google Maps API to create complex routes that pass through specific tourist places
- Learn about the places you will visit through the route description
- Share routes with other users

## Technologies

The front-end of the app was made using JSX, Sass and JavaScript. The back-end uses MongoDB for storing data and Railway for the API. Google Maps API is used to create and display routes.

## Known Bugs

- Search bar not working
- First page presented is empty; you need to press the "Home" button
- To share a route, you need to first press the "Share Route" button and after the "Share" button
- Styles are currently a placeholder

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, simply visit the deployed website and start browsing the available routes. To create your own route, simply click on the "Create Route" button and follow the instructions on the screen.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Traveling Web App! If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. If you would like to contribute code, please open a pull request.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
